# Usage

Start it with `webmenu` command. It should be kept running always.

Webmenu does not create a launcher automatically yet. You must create it
manually to what ever panel you are using.

The launcher command is following:

    nc -U ~/.config/webmenu/spawnmenu

Just create Unity, gnome-panel, whatever entry for it.
