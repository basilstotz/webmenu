# config.json

Webmenu configuration

## Location

Webmenu will look it from following locations:

  1. the bundled config.json
  2. /etc/webmenu/config.json
  3. ~/.config/webmenu/config.json

It will read file from each locations and merges those into a single
configuration object. The options in latter ones will override options in
previous ones. So users can for example just override a `logoutCMD` in
`~/.config/webmenu/config.json` if needed.
