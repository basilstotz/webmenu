# Installation

Webmenu runs on relatively new Ubuntu releases such as Precise Pangolin and Quantal Quetzal.

## .deb installation

Get .deb package from [downloads](https://github.com/opinsys/webmenu/downloads)
double click on it to install it with Ubuntu's graphical packaging tool.

Or use dpkg:

    sudo dpkg -i webmenu_0.1.0-1_i386.deb

The package contains the Webmenu itself, node.js and all the required node.js
modules. The package has few dependencies, but they should be all found from
the default Ubuntu repositories.
